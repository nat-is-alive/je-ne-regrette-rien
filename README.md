A project to retrofit Console.WriteLine from C# and System.out.println from Java to TypeScript.

Why? To demonstrate the syntactic similarities of the languages, using the if statement control structure as an example.

Purpose: A learning exercise to show new programmers that ignoring the "you must learn this language first" rhetoric and just getting started with 
any language will give them transferrable, fundamental skills and knowledge that they can carry in to most programming languages.
